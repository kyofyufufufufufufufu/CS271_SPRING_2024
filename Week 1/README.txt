5 topics related to my interests in computing:

1. I'm really into emulation. It's something I'm genuinely interested in and some major examples I can currently think of is running games that were originally on console onto your PC. 

2. Simulation, too. I really would love to make train or plane simulators.

3. Cybersecurity is a growing field that I have considered at OSU with their new program, but I'm still on the fence about that. But I do know that those skills are pretty valuable and the job growth in cybersecurity is looking pretty good. In general, though, I do like the idea of ethical hacking because it sounds fun and very challenging.

4. Problem solving in computing is one of the main points that drove me to entering CS. I get really excited when everything starts to work out or I finally realize how to fix an issue I was having in my code. 

5. Computer Science and its impact on society. I've taken so many classes dealing with social constructs, racism, oppression, etc and it always gives me so much motivation to continue working on making the world a better place. That includes technology, too. https://northwestern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1a7b3416-148c-4c48-bb58-aced01472441 (I'm not sure if this link will send you to the event video!) But I recently watched an event called Algorithms and Their Social Impact. Many speakers were involved in the event talking about how we use CS and its bias against certain demographics. The topics mainly fall on law and how it affects people. I think this is so important in many areas of CS.

5 topics that I struggle with:

1. Concepts. I really struggle with conceptual thinking and work mostly with my technical brain. It's definitely something I'm working on with each term.

2. C language. I did well in my CS 133-C class (got an A!) But structs, arrays, and pointers were a huge hurdle for me, so I'm a bit scared to tackle C++. But I will do my best!

3. Data Structures. I actually have no idea what data structures are (I know I'm new, but still!) and I hope that this struggle will be short-lived as I continue learning in this class!

4. Algorithms. I've read on the OSU online CS subreddit that the first two hardest classes that students face in CS are CS 260 (or 261 at OSU) and CS 271 are some of the more difficult ones.

5. Debugging. It's so hard! I've also read that quite a lot of students don't like it, but I understand that it's very important for our work.
